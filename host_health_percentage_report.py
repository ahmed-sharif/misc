#
# Queries for check state can be batched such that we retrieve checks for
# multiple hosts at once. While OBHC is extremely fast to respond to most
# queries, ATS will often return errors on large queries (either due to the
# large number of host names in the query parameters, or due to timeouts). To
# work around this, queries are chunked. 500 is known to work everywhere.
